* The EEG data can be accessed at [Tsinghua Cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/84caed5b9fac4816a1ba/)

**Noticing that the complete EEG cleaned data is about 62G (35G after compression) and we deployed the dataset on our lab platform.** 

**We also provide the DE feature of EEG per second.**

**The data to run baseline (be normalized and calculate the average of seconds) is provided at '/data/EEG_data/EEG_DE_avg'.**
